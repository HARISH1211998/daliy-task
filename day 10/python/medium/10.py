### Task day 10 -> Task: Accept a list of numbers and print the median value.(The median is the "middle value" when numbers are sorted in ascending order.
# If the list has odd numbers â†’ the middle element is the median.
# If the list has even numbers â†’ the median is the average of the two middle elements.

# Examples

# Case 1: Odd number of values
# Numbers: 3, 1, 7
# Sorted: 1, 3, 7
# ğŸ‘‰ Middle value = 3 (Median = 3)

# Case 2: Even number of values
# Numbers: 10, 40, 20, 30
# Sorted: 10, 20, 30, 40
# ğŸ‘‰ Middle two values = 20 and 30
# Median = (20 + 30) Ã· 2 = 25 )
